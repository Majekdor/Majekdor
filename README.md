## Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kevin. I'm a full time college student on the East Coast studying computer engineering with a minor in computer programming.
In my free time I enjoy coding a number of different things. I've written a few Minecraft plugins and recently have been getting into JavaScript and HTML/CSS for website design.

## Languages
As you can see below, I primarily code in Java. I also have experience in JavaScript and Python, though mostly for school (which is why they're not on this GitHub).
I am fairly comfortable, or working to be comfortable, in these languages:
- Java
- JavaScript
- Python
- HTML
- CSS

## Contact Me
If you'd like to contact me, the best way is via my [Discord](https://discord.gg/CGgvDUz) server. After you join, you can post in one of the channels or message me directly. If you want to message me directly that's fine, but please don't send me a friend request, it's not necessary. 
If you don't have Discord you're also welcome to [email](mailto:majekdor@gmail.com) me.

If you would like a plugin made please keep in mind that I'm a full time college student and don't have the most free time. I mostly do plugins that pique my interest or are for commission. If you're having a problem with an existing plugin, either open an issue or yell at me in [Discord](https://discord.gg/CGgvDUz), preferably the latter.
