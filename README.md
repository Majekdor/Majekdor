## Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kevin. I'm a full time college student on the east coast studying computer engineering.

In my free time I enjoy coding a number of different things. I'm currently working on developing a location sharing app for iOS using Swift and SwiftUI. I've written a few Minecraft plugins and some highly mediocre websites (aren't they all though?) with JavaScript and HTML/CSS. If you need to contact me please join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/CGgvDUz) or send an email to [me@kevbarnes.com](mailto:me@kevbarnes.com). If you have an issue with any of my projects please open an issue here on GitHub and join my discord if I need more information.

> Note: All of my open source Minecraft plugins have moved [here](https://github.com/MajekDev).
