## Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kevin. I'm a full time college student on the east coast studying computer engineering.

In my free time I enjoy coding a number of different things. I've written a few Minecraft plugins and recently have been getting into JavaScript and HTML/CSS for website design. If you need to contact me please just join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/CGgvDUz). If you have an issue with any of my projects please open an issue here on GitHub and join my discord if I need more information.

> Note: All of my open source Minecraft plugins have moved [here](https://github.com/MajekDev).
